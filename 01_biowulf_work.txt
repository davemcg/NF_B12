#1 move lane bams from trek to biowulf2:/data/mcgaugheyd/projects/nhgri/brody/NF_B12_mouse
rsync -rav trek.nhgri.nih.gov:/cluster/ifs/projects/solexa/reads/160614_YOSHI_C90KTANXX/ .
# then I later realized I pulled lane bams from an entire machine run. Oops.
# so I had to hand retain the files for this project: matrix.txt

#2 now need to shuffle the bam files and extract fastq
swarm -f ~/git/NF_B12/bam2fq.swarm --module samtools --partition=quick

#3 then gzip
swarm -f ~/git/NF_B12/gzip_fq.swarm --partition-quick

# next is to align with kallisto
# "reference free alignment"
# but requires gene info
~/git/NF_B12/./kallisto_sbatch.sh 

# then align with STAR
# the "old school" approach, not sure if going with this or using kallisto for quantification
# plus qorts quantificatino is unhappy with the NISC bams
~/git/NF_B12/./star_run.sh

####
# kallisto and star scripts cannot be run directly since I do not retain the NISC lane bams and the associated fastq files, as this is a poor use of disk space 
# scripts provided to provide information on version numbers and to make it straightforward to re-run (should you do #1, #2, and #3)
####

# qorts for QC
# run in STAR_bams folder
# /data/mcgaugheyd/projects/nhgri/brody/NF_B12_mouse/STAR_bams
